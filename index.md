## About the contents
I have not included every resource purporting to teach Irish for reasons [better explained by another individual here.](https://irishlanguage.ie/a-caution-to-learners-of-irish/)

Where I have included educational resources I have attempted to keep to those which enable learners to acquire Irish in a way approximating that of native speakers, with correct pronunciation, idiom and natural features. However, when attempting to map communities and other organisations it can become very difficult to completely exclude heavily anglicised Irish. It is therefore advisable to attempt to develop an understanding of what native Irish sounds and reads like, and make your own judgments.

### Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with any organisation, community or individual included here beyond casual acquaintance. Inclusion on this list is not an endorsement on my part of any views, opinions or values that may be found therein. Entries have been included on the basis of usefulness in acquiring Irish only.
